**Who creates it:** Main PM (in Pipeline bucket)
**Who updates it:** Main PM primarily, Regional PMs add regional-specific updates

**Card Structure Overview:**
- Title: "NPI - [PLC Name] - [Project Code]" (ex: "NPI - Calima - CAL-001")
- Description: Executive summary of the project
- Assigned to: Main PM
- Start date: Concept date or go-live date (depends on organization preference)
- Due date: Launch date
- Bucket: Moves from Pipeline → GA → RA → Engage → Kick-off → Execute → Hypercare → Close-out
- Priority: High/Important (most NPI projects)
- Progress: Visually shows completion % as regional cards are completed
- Sub-tasks: Optional summary level activities

**Reading an Upstream Card:**
- Click the card to open detail view
- Scan the custom fields for key info:
  - Planisware ID (links to financial data)
  - Global Service Model (what we're delivering)
  - Launch Date (when it happens)
  - Regions Involved (how many to coordinate)
  - Complexity Rating (how complex is this?)
- Review attachments for project summary or business case
- Check progress bar (% of regions at each phase)

**When you'll interact with Upstream cards:**

### III.C: Day-to-Day Tasks & Card Management

#### III.C.1: Creating a New Card (Regional PM perspective)

**Scenario:** It's time to create your regional card (during Regional Alignment phase)

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Navigate to the Upstream card** for your project
2. **Look at the regional card template** (your Main PM should provide this or it should be in Teams folder)
3. **Click "+ Add card"** in the RA bucket (or relevant bucket)
4. **Fill in required fields:**
   - **Title:** "[PLC] - [Region] - Regional Readiness"
   - **Assigned to:** You (Regional PM)
   - **Start date:** When your RA starts
   - **Due date:** Regional launch date (or phase end date)
   - **Description:** Copy from template, customize for your region
5. **Save the card**
6. **Create the link to Upstream card:** (See section III.C.5 on dependencies)
7. **Add custom fields:** (See section III.D on custom fields)
8. **Create sub-tasks:** (See section III.C.2)
9. **Share with your team** by adding them to the card or Teams channel

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Creating regional card before RA phase officially starts
- ❌ Forgetting to link to Upstream card
- ❌ Using non-standard naming convention
- ❌ Not filling in required custom fields
- ❌ Creating sub-tasks without clear ownership

#### III.C.2: Creating Sub-Tasks (Functional deliverables)

**Scenario:** You need to break down your regional card into specific deliverables

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Open your regional card**
2. **Look for "Sub-tasks" section** (or "Checklist")
3. **Click "+ Add sub-task"**
4. **Fill in:**
   - **Title:** Specific deliverable name
   - **Assigned to:** The functional SME (Training lead, Service manager, etc.)
   - **Due date:** When that deliverable is needed (usually before Kick-off)
   - **Notes:** Context, links to templates, requirements
5. **Click "Add"** to create
6. **Notify the assigned SME** (in Teams or email) that they have a new sub-task
7. **Set a reminder** to follow up if sub-task isn't started 2 weeks before due date

**Template Sub-Tasks (Copy & Customize):**
- [ ] Create Training Materials - [Function Area] - Due: [X weeks before KO]
- [ ] Develop Standard Operating Procedure - [Function Area] - Due: [X weeks before KO]
- [ ] Identify Required Spare Parts & Inventory - Due: [6 weeks before launch]
- [ ] Schedule Launch Day Communications - Due: [2 weeks before launch]
- [ ] Confirm Regional Readiness (sign-off) - Due: [1 week before launch]

#### III.C.3: Updating Card Status & Progress

**Daily/Weekly Routine:**

**For cards assigned to you (Regional PM):**
1. **Check "My Tasks"** view every morning
2. **For each card/sub-task assigned to you:**
   - Is it still on track? Yes → Move to next priority
   - Is it blocked? Yes → Escalate (see escalation section)
   - Is it complete? Yes → Mark complete (see below)
3. **Update the "Next Activity Date"** field with your next action
4. **Add a comment in Teams** if significant update (governance call reminder, blocker alert, etc.)

**Marking a Sub-Task Complete:**
1. **Open the sub-task**
2. **Click the checkmark or "Mark complete"** button
3. **Add completion notes** if relevant
4. **Notify the team** (sub-task completion may unblock others)

**Updating Overall Card Progress:**
- In Grid view, you'll see a progress bar
- Progress is auto-calculated from sub-task completion % 
- **If progress isn't updating correctly:** Check that sub-tasks are actually marked complete (not just "in progress")

**Weekly Status Update (for Regional PM):**
1. **Review all your regional cards** (use "My Tasks" filter)
2. **Update "Next Activity Date"** on each card
3. **Check all sub-tasks** - any at risk? Any blocked?
4. **Add a comment** summarizing the week's progress
5. **Send a quick update** to your Main PM and OU contact
   - Format: "On track" | "Minor Risk" | "Major Risk" + 1-2 sentence explanation

#### III.C.4: Moving Cards Between Buckets (Phase Progression)

**What it means:** When a project moves from one phase to the next (ex: GA → RA), the card physically moves to a new Bucket

**Who can move cards:** Main PM (Upstream), Regional PM (Regional cards)

**Step-by-step (in Board view):**
1. **Find the card** you want to move
2. **Drag the card** to the next Bucket (or right-click → Move)
3. **Verify the move** - the card now appears in new Bucket
4. **Update relevant fields:**
   - Start date (first day of new phase)
   - Due date (last day of new phase, usually = launch or gate date)
5. **Add a comment** explaining why it moved (ex: "Moved to Engage - GA complete, regional SME names received")
6. **Notify the team** in Teams that phase has progressed

**Before You Move a Card - Checklist:**
- ✓ Are all required fields populated?
- ✓ Have all sub-tasks for this phase been started/completed?
- ✓ Is the next phase's timeline realistic?
- ✓ Have key stakeholders approved (Main PM, OU contact)?
- ✓ Are all risks documented?

**Common Phase Progression:**
1. **Pipeline → GA:** Initiated by Main PM when project is approved
2. **GA → RA:** Initiated by Main PM when global service model is agreed
3. **RA → Engage:** Initiated by Regional PM when regional service model is confirmed
4. **Engage → Kick-off:** Initiated by Regional PM when SME commitments are received
5. **Kick-off → Execute:** Initiated by Regional PM when project plan is approved
6. **Execute → Hypercare:** Initiated by Regional PM when go-live is reached
7. **Hypercare → Close-out:** Initiated by Regional PM when 30-day monitoring is complete

**If you move a card backward:** ⚠️ This is a flag! It usually means something wasn't ready. Make a note and escalate to your Main PM.

#### III.C.5: Understanding & Creating Dependencies

**What is a dependency?** One card depends on another card finishing first (or starting at the same time)

**Why it matters:** Helps you see what work blocks what, and avoid surprises

**Dependency Types in Planner:**
- **Finish-to-Start (FS):** Card A must finish before Card B starts (most common)
  - Example: Global Alignment → Regional Alignment
- **Start-to-Start (SS):** Card A must start before Card B can start
  - Example: Multiple regions starting training on same week
- **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** Card A must finish before Card B can finish
  - Example: All regions must complete their deliverables before project closing
- **Start-to-Finish (SF):** Card A must start before Card B can finish (rare)
  - Example: Hypercare must start before Execute can officially close

**How to Create a Dependency:**

1. **Open the card** that depends on another
2. **Find the "Dependencies" section** (usually near the bottom)
3. **Click "+ Add dependency"**
4. **Select the relationship type** (Finish-to-Start, etc.)
5. **Search for the card** it depends on (by name or project)
6. **Save the dependency**
7. **Verify** in Timeline view that the dates now show the relationship

**Reading Dependencies in Timeline View:**
- **Vertical lines connecting cards** = dependencies
- **Red lines** = dependency broken (predecessor is late, dependent card is now at risk)
- **Green lines** = dependency is healthy

**Best Practice:** Link each Regional card to its Upstream card (Finish-to-Start: Upstream's GA phase must finish before Regional card starts)

**Field #8: Playbook Status** (Regional cards)
- **What it is:** Which Playbook sections are complete?
- **Options:** Section 1 Pending | Section 1 Complete | Section 2 Pending | Section 2 Complete | Section 3 Pending | Section 3 Complete | Section 4 Pending | Section 4 Complete
- **Who fills it:** Regional PM (tracks progress as team completes sections)
- **When updated:** Ongoing as you progress through RA, Engage, Kick-off
- **Why it matters:** Shows readiness, governance approval gate, regional compliance

**Field #9: Risk Status** (Upstream & Regional cards)
- **What it is:** Current risk level
- **Options:** Green (On Track) | Yellow (Minor Risk) | Red (Major Risk) | Blocked
- **Who fills it:** Regional PM or Main PM (whoever owns the card)
- **When updated:** Weekly (or immediately if status changes)
- **Example risks:**
  - Yellow: One regional SME delayed, can catch up
  - Red: Key SME not available, timeline now unrealistic
  - Blocked: Waiting for another project to complete, can't proceed
- **Why it matters:** Governance visibility, escalation trigger

**Field #10: Stakeholder Contact** (Regional cards)
- **What it is:** Name + email of OU contact (regional decision-maker)
- **Format:** "Name (Title) - email@company.com"
- **Who fills it:** Regional PM (gets from OU contact)

#### III.D.3: How to Fill Custom Fields

**When creating a new card:**
1. **Open the card detail view**
2. **Scroll down to "Custom Fields" section**
3. **For each field marked with a star (★):**
   - Click the field
   - Enter or select the value
   - Click outside the field to save
4. **For optional fields:**
   - Fill in only if you have the info
   - Ask your Main PM if unsure
5. **Save the card**

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Leaving required fields blank
- ❌ Entering wrong format (ex: "1/15/24" instead of "01/15/2024")
- ❌ Choosing the wrong option (ex: "SM" instead of "Small")
- ❌ Not updating fields as situation changes

#### III.D.4: When to Update Custom Fields

**Weekly:** Risk Status, Playbook Status (if changed)
**Monthly:** During governance call prep
**Immediately:** If risk status changes, or Major blocker appears
**Never:** Planisware ID (set once in GA/RA, don't change), Global Service Model (set in GA, regional PM can't change)

---

### III.E: Tracking Progress & Timelines

#### III.E.1: Understanding Your Card Timeline

**What you'll see:**
- **Start date:** First day of current phase
- **Due date:** Last day of phase (usually = launch date or gate deadline)
- **Remaining days:** Countdown to due date (shown in card)
- **Progress bar:** Percentage of sub-tasks completed

**Reading the Timeline:**
- Green card = On track (due date is in future, progress is steady)
- Yellow card = At risk (due date is approaching, progress is slow)
- Red card = Overdue or Major risk (due date has passed or significant blocker)

#### III.E.2: Using Timeline View for Schedule Management

**When to use Timeline view:**
- Planning your project schedule
- Seeing critical path (what must happen when)
- Identifying bottlenecks (what's blocking what?)
- Communicating timeline to stakeholders

**How to read Timeline view:**
1. **Find your card** on the timeline
2. **See the bar** representing from start date to due date
3. **Look for red lines** connecting cards = dependencies
4. **Red lines** mean: Task on left must finish before task on right starts
5. **If a line is red**, it means the predecessor is at risk

**Example scenario:**
- Global Alignment card (ends 3/15)
- Regional Alignment card (starts 3/20, depends on GA)
- If GA runs late past 3/15, the dependency line turns red = RA is now at risk

#### III.E.3: Next Activity Date (Critical Field)

**What it is:** Your next planned action on this card

**Why it matters:**
- Helps PM see what's coming next
- Signals if work is stalled
- Helps you prioritize your week
- Used in governance reporting

**How to use it:**
1. **Update every Friday** with next week's activity
2. **Format:** MM/DD/YYYY (or "TBD" if uncertain)
3. **Examples:**
   - "01/20/2025 - Schedule SME kickoff call"
   - "01/23/2025 - Review training draft from team"
   - "TBD - Waiting for marketing review"
4. **If you don't update it:** PM will ask "What's next?" in governance call

---

### III.F: Communication & Collaboration

#### III.F.1: In-Card Communication (Teams Integration)

**Using the conversation thread in a card:**
1. **Open the card**
2. **Find "Conversation" or "Comments" tab**
3. **Click in message box**
4. **Type your update** (ex: "Training draft complete, sent to Main PM for review")
5. **Click "Post"** or "@mention" a specific person
6. **Team members get notified** in Teams channel

**Best practices:**
- ✓ Use for project updates and decisions
- ✓ Mention specific people if they need to respond
- ✓ Keep it professional and concise
- ✗ Don't use for casual chat (that's for Teams channel)
- ✗ Don't use for back-and-forth arguments (take to 1:1 call)

**Example good comment:**
"Regional SME review complete. All training modules approved by Service Manager. Ready to move to Kick-off phase. @Maria Santos - can you confirm regional readiness by 1/20?"

#### III.F.2: Planner in Teams Channel

**Accessing your project board in Teams:**
1. **Go to your project Teams channel**
2. **Look for "Planner" tab** at the top
3. **Click it to see the board**
4. **All Planner updates are reflected here**
5. **You can right-click cards to see options**

**Notifications:**
- You get pinged when:
  - Someone assigns a card to you
  - Someone comments and mentions you
  - A card is moved to a new bucket (if you're watching)
  - A sub-task is due soon
- **Manage notifications:** Settings → Notifications

#### III.F.3: Escalation Paths (When to Ask for Help)

**Use this chart to decide who to ask:**

| Issue | Who to Contact | How | Urgency |
|-------|---|---|---|
| I don't understand a field | My Regional PM or Main PM | Teams message or call | 24 hours |
| I'm blocked and can't proceed | My Regional PM | Teams message or call | Same day |
| Regional stakeholder won't commit | Regional Service Leader or People Leader | Escalate through PM | 24 hours |
| Timeline is unrealistic | Regional PM + Main PM | Governance call or urgent 1:1 | Immediate |
| Technical issue with Planner | IT Help Desk | Help ticket | 24 hours |
| I need access to someone else's board | Your Regional PM | Email request | 48 hours |
| I think we should change the process | Your Main PM and governance team | Feedback form or meeting | Anytime |

**Escalation template (when you message):**
"I'm working on [card name]. The issue is: [specific problem]. The impact is: [why it matters]. I suggest: [proposed solution]. Can we discuss by [target date]?"

Example: "I'm working on 'Singapore Training Delivery'. The issue is: Training SME is overbooked and can only start in March vs. January. The impact is: Timeline is now 2 months behind critical path. I suggest: We hire a training contractor or reduce scope. Can we discuss by Friday?"

### III.G: Common Scenarios & How to Handle Them

#### III.G.1: Scenario 1 - You're a Regional PM Creating Your First Card

**Situation:** You've just been assigned as Regional PM. You need to create your regional card.

**What to do:**
1. **Get the template:** Ask your Main PM for the regional card template (should be in Teams or shared folder)
2. **Copy the template to your board:** Right-click the template card → Copy card → Paste in RA bucket
3. **Fill in custom fields:**
   - Planisware ID: Ask Main PM
   - Regional Service Model: Confirm with your Regional Service Leader
   - Complexity Rating: Rate your region honestly
   - Launch Date: Confirm with OU contact
   - Stakeholder Contact: You (or your OU contact)
4. **Create sub-tasks:** For each deliverable your team needs to complete (training, SOPs, etc.)
5. **Assign sub-tasks:** To the functional SME who will do the work
6. **Share with your team:** Add them to the card and Teams channel
7. **Send a kick-off note:** "Regional card is live. Here's what we need to complete by [date]. Please check your assigned sub-tasks."

#### III.G.2: Scenario 2 - A Sub-Task Owner Isn't Responding

**Situation:** You assigned a Training SME to create training materials (sub-task due in 3 weeks). It's been 2 weeks with no progress.

**What to do:**
1. **Check the sub-task:** Is it marked "In Progress"? If not, follow up.
2. **Send a friendly reminder:** "Hi [Name], I assigned you 'Create Training Materials' which is due [date]. Can you give me a quick update on progress?"
3. **If no response in 2 days:** Escalate to their manager or the Regional PM
4. **If truly blocked:** Document it as a Risk (sub-task status = Red/Blocked)
5. **Update the governance call:** Mention the blocker and proposed solution
6. **Adjust timeline if needed:** If the SME can't do it, either:
   - Assign to someone else
   - Reduce scope
   - Extend timeline (with approval)

#### III.G.3: Scenario 3 - Go-Live Date Just Got Moved Up

**Situation:** Your regional launch was scheduled for 6/15 but marketing needs it done by 5/15 (1 month earlier).

**What to do:**
1. **Reality check:** Can your team really deliver in 1 month? Or is this risky?
2. **Talk to your Regional Service Leader:** What has to give? (Scope, resources, quality?)
3. **Update the card:**
   - Change "Launch Date (Regional)" to 5/15
   - Update all sub-task due dates to move forward
   - Add comment explaining the change
4. **Add a Risk:** Escalate to Main PM and governance team if timeline is now unrealistic
5. **Re-communicate with your team:** Make sure they know the new timeline
6. **Track closely:** With compressed timelines, risks increase

#### III.G.4: Scenario 4 - You Discovered We're Missing a Requirement

**Situation:** You're in Kick-off and realize the regional service model requires a new certification that no one has completed.

**What to do:**
1. **Immediately escalate:** Tell your Regional PM/Main PM
2. **Create a Risk:** Add to the card with high priority
3. **Don't ignore it:** This will come back as a problem on launch day
4. **Options to solve:**
   - Accelerate certification (bring trainer in early)
   - Reduce scope (start without that certification, phase it in)
   - Delay launch (move 5/15 back to 6/15)
5. **Escalate to leadership:** Regional Service Leader needs to decide what to do
6. **Document the decision:** Add to card comments so everyone knows what was decided
