### IV.A.3: Board Management Best Practices

#### Creating and Maintaining Boards

**Board Naming Convention:**
- Format: "PLC - RR - [Project Name] - [Region]"
- Example: "PLC - RR - Calima - 01 Singapore"
- Why: Consistent, sortable, professional, clear ownership

**Board Structure:**
- **Buckets (Phases):** Pipeline, GA, RA, Engage, Kick-off, Execute, Hypercare, Close-out
- **One Upstream card** per project (in PLC-specific board)
- **Multiple Regional cards** (one per region, same board as Upstream)
- **Sub-tasks** organized under each Regional card

**Teams Integration:**
- Create project channel: "npi-[project-code]" (ex: "npi-calima")
- Add Planner tab linking to board
- Post announcements in channel when phases progress
- Use channel for team discussions, Planner for project data

**SharePoint Folder Structure:**
```
Project Folder: [PLC] - [Project Code]
├── 01_Global_Alignment
│   ├── Business Case
│   ├── Service Model Decision
│   └── Playbook Section 1
├── 02_Regional_Alignment
│   ├── Region_Singapore
│   │   ├── Playbook Section 2
│   │   └── Regional Plan
│   ├── Region_India
│   │   └── ...
├── 03_Execution_Artifacts
│   ├── Training Materials
│   ├── Service Procedures
│   └── Go-Live Communication
└── 04_Close-Out
    └── Lessons Learned
```

#### Permission Management

**Who Gets What Access:**

| Role | Access Level | Can Create Cards | Can Move Cards | Can Edit Fields |
|------|--------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Main PM | Full Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Regional PM | Full Edit | Yes | Yes (own region) | Yes |
| SME | Limited | No | No | No (only assigned sub-tasks) |
| Regional Service Leader | View | No | No | No |
| Executive | View | No | No | No |

---

### IV.A.4: Custom Field Quality Standards

#### Maintaining Data Integrity

**Weekly Field Audit:**
Every Friday, scan all cards for:
- ✓ All ⭐ fields populated (none blank)
- ✓ Planisware IDs match expected format
- ✓ Dates are realistic (not duplicated, not in past)
- ✓ Risk Status current (not stale)
- ✓ Complexity ratings reasonable (not changed without explanation)

**Common Data Quality Issues:**

| Issue | Impact | How to Fix |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Blank Planisware ID | Can't track to financial system | Get from Finance, update immediately |
| Wrong date format | Causes sorting/filtering errors | Standardize to MM/DD/YYYY |
| "TBD" in required field | Blocks governance approval | Set deadline for when info available |
| Risk Status = Green but card is late | Misleading status | Update to Yellow/Red with explanation |
| Complexity downgraded without note | Appears like you're reducing scope | Document why in comment |

**Communicating Changes:**
When you find an error in a card:
1. **Document it** in a comment: "Found: [Issue]. Cause: [Why]. Fixed: [Action taken]."
2. **Correct it** immediately
3. **Notify affected people** (Regional PM or SME who will be confused)

---

### IV.A.5: Risk Management

#### Identifying Risk Early

**Risk Indicators to Watch:**

| Red Flag | What It Means | Action |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Sub-task not started, due in 2 weeks | Resource issue, timeline at risk | Escalate to Regional PM |
| Card hasn't been updated in 1 month | Stalled, no owner engagement | PM needs to contact owner |
| Risk Status = Yellow for 3+ weeks | Issue not resolving, needs help | Escalate to Regional Service Leader |
| Regional PM missing governance call | Possible critical blocker | Call to check in immediately |
| Playbook section overdue | Governance gate can't be approved | Escalate, document blocker |
| New complexity discovered mid-project | Scope increased, resources insufficient | Re-baseline timeline |

**Risk Assessment Framework:**

| Risk Level | Definition | Escalation Path | Response Time |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Green** | On track, no issues | None | Monthly review |
| **Yellow** | Minor issue, recoverable | Regional PM → Service Leader | 1-2 weeks to resolve |
| **Red** | Major issue, likely to miss deadline | Regional PM → Service Leader → Main PM | Immediate decision needed |
| **Blocked** | Can't proceed at all | Main PM → Leadership | Same day escalation |

---

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**When Risk = Yellow (Minor Issue):**
1. Identify the root cause (resource, timeline, dependency)
2. Propose 2-3 mitigation options:
   - Extend timeline (by how much?)
   - Reduce scope (what gets cut?)
   - Add resources (what's the cost/availability?)
3. Present to Regional Service Leader with pros/cons of each
4. Make decision and update plan
5. Monitor closely (weekly check-ins)

**When Risk = Red (Major Issue):**
1. Stop. Don't try to hide it.
2. Escalate immediately to Main PM + Regional Service Leader
3. Get leadership on a call (same day if possible)
4. Present options and financial/schedule impact clearly
5. Leadership decides direction (proceed, delay, reduce scope, add resources)
6. Update Planner with decision and new plan

## IV.B: Timeline & Dependency Management for PMs

### IV.B.1: Building Project Schedules

#### Timeline Fundamentals

**Start with Launch Date (Immovable)**
1. Global launch date is set by business (marketing, sales, customers)
2. Work backwards from launch date to determine phase timelines
3. Build in buffers (don't assume everything finishes on time)

**Phase Duration Estimates:**
- Pipeline → GA: 8-12 weeks (depends on complexity)
- GA → RA: 4-8 weeks
- RA → Engage: 4-8 weeks
- Engage → Kick-off: 2-4 weeks
- Kick-off → Execute: 4-12 months (depends on training scope)
- Execute → Hypercare: 30 days (fixed)
- Hypercare → Close-out: 1-2 weeks

**Critical Path Analysis:**
1. Identify what must happen first (dependencies)
2. Identify what can happen in parallel
3. Find the longest chain of dependent activities (critical path)
4. Focus risk mitigation on critical path items (if one slips, whole project slips)

**Example:** 
- Global launch: 6/15/2025
- Work backwards:
  - Hypercare needs 30 days: 5/15 - 6/15
  - Execute needs 6 months minimum: 11/15/2024 - 5/15/2025
  - Kick-off needs 3 weeks before Execute: 11/1/2024
  - And so on...

---

#### Buffer Planning

**The 20% Buffer Rule:**
- If a phase normally takes 8 weeks, plan for 10 weeks (20% buffer)
- If 6 months, plan for 7-7.5 months
- Buffer absorbs unexpected delays without catastrophic timeline slips

**Where to Apply Buffer:**
- ✓ Between major phases (4-8 week phases get 1 week buffer)
- ✓ Before critical dates (launch gets 2-week buffer minimum)
- ✓ For new regions (first time is slower, build in extra time)
- ✗ NOT in project plan (don't tell team they have extra time; keeps them accountable)

**Why Buffer Matters:**
- One region delayed? You have buffer to catch up.
- One SME gets sick? Team can adjust.
- One deliverable takes longer? You still hit launch.

---

### IV.B.2: Managing Dependencies Across Regional Cards

#### Sequencing Regions

**Sequential (One After Another):**
- First region launches, you get feedback, apply to next region
- Pros: Learn and improve, less resource contention
- Cons: Takes longer, market may need coordinated launch
- Use when: New product, high training requirements

**Parallel (All at Once):**
- All regions launch on same date
- Pros: Single launch event, faster to market, less customer confusion
- Cons: More resources, less learning time, higher risk
- Use when: Market demands coordinated launch, mature service model

**Mixed (Staggered):**
- Early adopter regions first (1-2 weeks), then main regions
- Pros: Balance between learning and speed
- Cons: More complex to coordinate
- Use when: You need some learning but also need speed

---

#### Dependency Chains

**Example Dependency Chain:**

```
Upstream (GA complete)
    ↓ (FS dependency)
Regional Card SG (RA starts)
    ↓ (internal: Training → Training Delivery)
Regional Card SG (Training delivery before Execute)
    ↓ (FS dependency)
Regional Card SG (Execute can start)
    ↓ (FS dependency: SG must complete before India)
Regional Card India (RA can start, learning from SG)
```

**Managing Chains:**
- Create explicit dependencies in Planner
- Review Timeline view regularly (watch for red dependency lines)
- Flag predecessor delays immediately (dependent cards now at risk)
- Never proceed with dependent card if predecessor is at risk

---

### IV.B.3: Schedule Risk Management

#### Red Lines in Timeline = Broken Dependencies

**When Timeline View Shows Red Line:**
1. **Find the predecessor card** (card on left side of red line)
2. **Check its status:**
   - Is it delayed? How many days?
   - Is it still at risk? Or just slightly behind?
3. **Impact assessment:**
   - If predecessor is 1 week late, is dependent card still OK? (maybe, if has buffer)
   - If predecessor is 3 weeks late, dependent card is now at critical risk
4. **Mitigation:**
   - Can dependent card start anyway (in parallel)?
   - Should we adjust timeline for dependent card?
   - Do we need to escalate?

---

#### Schedule Recovery

**If You're Behind Schedule:**

1. **Assess the gap:**
   - How many days behind? (2 days vs. 2 weeks = very different)
   - Which phase? (early phases have less impact than execution)
   - Critical path? (on critical path = urgent; off critical path = manageable)

2. **Consider options:**
   - **Compress phase:** Start next phase before this one ends (overlapping)
     - Pros: Recover some time
     - Cons: Increases risk (not fully ready for next phase)
   - **Add resources:** More people, more equipment
     - Pros: May catch up
     - Cons: Cost, ramp-up time, management overhead
   - **Reduce scope:** Cut non-critical deliverables
     - Pros: Achievable, lowers risk
     - Cons: May reduce quality, disappoint stakeholders
   - **Extend timeline:** Push launch date back
     - Pros: Everything gets more time, lower risk
     - Cons: Business/market impact, cost

3. **Make the call:**
   - Decide which option with leadership
   - Document the decision in Planner
   - Communicate clearly (no surprises)

### IV.C.2: Using the Project Manager Agent

#### AI-Powered Insights (Planner Premium Feature)

**The Project Manager Agent can:**
- Generate automated status reports from card data
- Identify at-risk projects based on patterns (overdue cards, stalled progress)
- Suggest next actions based on project stage
- Summarize weeks of progress in one comment
- Highlight missing information (blank fields, overdue deliverables)

**How to Use It:**

1. **Ask for status update:**
   - "Summarize progress on Project Calima this week"
   - Agent pulls all updates and creates summary

2. **Ask for risk analysis:**
   - "Which projects are most at risk?"
   - Agent analyzes: Red cards, overdue items, stalled progress

3. **Ask for next steps:**
   - "What should happen on Project Delta next?"
   - Agent suggests: Next gate requirements, missing info, upcoming deadlines

**Limitations:**
- Agent uses data in Planner only (doesn't know external factors)
- Still requires human judgment for decisions (agent recommends, you decide)
- Only as good as the data entered (garbage in = garbage out)
