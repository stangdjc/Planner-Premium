# 🚀 Best Practices

## 🌐 Browser & Platform

- **Use Microsoft Edge** as the web browser for Planner or [https://planner.cloud.microsoft.com](https://planner.cloud.microsoft.com/)

## 🔗 Hyperlinks & Navigation

- **Create links** between Pipeline & Summary Cards for easy navigation
- **Link to Top Level Project Folder** for quick access to details

## 💬 In-Card Messaging

- Always use the **TEAMs app** or **TEAMs on Edge** for messaging within cards

## 🗂️ OU Boards Structure

- **Upstream Cards:**
    - Make OU board cards _sub-tasks_ to the main "Upstream" Card
    - Upstream cards serve as the **Header** for the project
    - This enables better organization and a top-level review of the project

### Example Structure

| Task Name                      | Assigned To | Start      |

|------------------------------- |-------------|------------|

| PLC - RR - Calima - 00 Upstream|             | 1/10/2025  |

| PLC - RR - Calima - 01 Singapore|            | 1/10/2025  |

| PLC - RR - Calima - 02 Malaysia|             | 1/10/2025  |

## 📊 Pipeline Board

- Use for **NPI, RPE, EOL, Intake Tasks**
- Ensure closure and tracking via OU Boards

## 🎨 Visuals

- Download **Icons/Customers PNG** with transparent backgrounds for presentations and documentation

> **TL;DR:**

- Use Edge for Planner
- Hyperlink between cards and folders
- Organize OU boards with Upstream headers
- Use TEAMs for in-card messaging
- Structure Pipeline Board for all major task types
- Use transparent PNG icons for visuals

# 📦 Pipeline – Common Understanding

**Location:**

- Regional Readiness Governance Teams – RR Projects Planner Board
- Global folder structure: PLC Regional Readiness – NPI Teams
- Section: 3. Global Alignment (Microsoft Teams)

## 🎯 Purpose

- During the **Initiate phase** ("To be reviewed" + Pipeline in Planner Board), global key stakeholders are identified, initial NPI information is gathered, and the global alignment step is initiated.
- The **Pipeline** is the first official step in the Planner board that captures upcoming NPIs.
- The upstream card contains a set of tasks for Pipeline, Global Alignment, and Regional Alignment.

## 🗓️ Timeline

- **Ideally:** At least 2 years before marketing launch

## 👤 Owner

- Regional Readiness

## 📝 When to Add to "To be Reviewed" or Pipeline Bucket?

- PLC PMO (or equivalent) informs Regional Readiness about an upcoming NPI
- Regional Readiness hears about a new product to be launched
- Centralized Intake (if Regional Readiness was not aware of an NPI)
- If the project is not well defined, add the card to the "To be reviewed" bucket.
- Once PMO (or equivalent) confirms the project will proceed, move the card to the Pipeline bucket.

## 📥 Input

- Request to support a new product entering global regions/markets

## 🏃 Actions

- Open a card in the Pipeline bucket (or "To be reviewed" bucket if needed first)
- Gather minimum NPI information from PMO or equivalent (OU contact, Go-live dates per region)
- Create a folder structure in the Teams channel (if needed):  
    PLC Regional Readiness – NPI Teams – 3. Global Alignment (Microsoft Teams)

## 📤 Output

- Populated Upstream card with minimum required information in RR Projects Planner Board

## 🌍 Global Steps

1. Global Initiate Alignment

## 🏢 Regional Steps

2. Regional Alignment
3. Regional Engage
4. Regional Kick-off
5. Execute
6. Regional Close Out

> **TL;DR:**
> 
> - Pipeline is the first step for capturing NPIs in the Planner board
> - Cards move from "To be reviewed" to Pipeline as projects are confirmed
> - Regional Readiness owns the process, with input from PMO and centralized intake
> - Actions include opening cards, gathering info, and creating folder structures
> - Follows a sequence: Global Initiate → Regional Alignment → Engage → Kick-off → Execute → Close Out

# 🚦 Pipeline – Main Process: Step by Step

## 1️⃣ Copy the Template Group

- **Copy** the "Template group" to the corresponding Portfolio.
- **Add** the NPI Name.
- All sub-region cards will be copied as well.
- **Remove** cards not applicable for your project.

> **Option 2:**\ Copy only the Upstream card (and regional cards if needed).\ After copying, create the title (in **bold**) by adding a new card above the Upstream one (use "promote subtask" or "make subtask" as needed).

## 2️⃣ RR Projects Board Setup

- **Navigate:**
    - RR Projects Board
    - My Plans
    - Filter by: Grid / Board

| Example Card Structure         |

|-------------------------------|

| RR - [Project Name] Templates |

    - **Bucket:**
        - "To be reviewed" → If project scope is unclear (discuss during governance call)
        - "Pipeline" → If project is going ahead and OU contact assigned
    - **Assigned to:**
        - Assign to project members (main PM) if defined
        - Otherwise, define during governance call
    - **Labels:** OU label

## 4️⃣ Minimum Required Information

- **Add to Notes/Fields:** (fields with a ★ are minimum required)
    - ★ Upstream Planisware ID
    - ★ Go-live dates per region (EMEA, LATAM, CAPAC, CANADA, GRC-Awareness)
    - ★ PMO/OU Contact
    - ★ Finish date (date first region goes live)

## 5️⃣ Escalation

- If you have trouble getting minimum info, escalate during governance calls or 1:1 with your manager.

## 6️⃣ File Management

- **Store NPI-relevant files** in the Global Alignment folder structure on Teams.
- **Add files to the card** as attachments (from computer or as a URL).
- If the Global Alignment folder is created, add a link to it in attachments.

| Attachment Example            |

|-------------------------------|

| deck test (file)              |

| [Project name] upstream folder (URL) |
